There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class.
"As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making."
"However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses."
"I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  "
"Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  "
Mr. Potter.
Our...new...celebrity.
"Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  "
You don't know?
"Well, let's try again."
"Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Pity.
"Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
Silence.  
"And put her hand down, you silly girl.  "
"For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death."
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  "
Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  
"And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
"Good luck today, Potter."
"Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
What?
Oh!
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
You know perfectly well what I mean.  
We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Good afternoon.
"Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
You want to be careful.
People will think you're  up to something.
You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
You have risked the exposure of our world.
Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Silence!
"I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight."
"As it is Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry."
"As such-- If I might, Headmaster?"
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"However, the circumstances are suspicious."
"I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
"Yes, Miss Granger? Expelliarmus!"
"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Might I suggest someone from my own house?
"Malfoy, perhaps?"
"Don't move, Potter."
I'll get rid of it for you.
Vipera evanesca.
"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart."
"Your moment has come, at last."
Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
"I've done the dungeons, headmaster."
"No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
"Remarkable feat, don't you think?"
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?
Any theories on how he managed it?
You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Turn to page 394.
"That's not really your concern, is it,"
Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
Quiet.
"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf?"
No one?
How disappointing.
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy."
That's the second time...
"you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger."
Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
Five points from Gryffindor.
"As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning..."
"two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it."
"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter."
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
"The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf."
"Werewolf, man-wolf."
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf...
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter."
"He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
Go on.
"Why, you insolent little..."
"Well, well."
Lupin.
"Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?"
That remains to be seen.
I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
"Take a look, Lupin."
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
"Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
"I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof."
Give me a reason.
I beg you!
"Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
"I could do it, you know."
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
"Oh, yes."
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
"It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
After you.
"There you are, Potter!"
"Come back here, Potter!"
"Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold."
Potter!
What's your hurry?
"Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring."
"Gilliweed, am I correct?"
Ingenious.
"A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden."
"Nor is this, know what it is?"
Veritaserum.
Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets.
"The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice."
Don't lie to me.
"Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin?"
lacewing flies?
You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.
Polyjuice potion.
"Sit, Potter."
"As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency."
"The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency."
Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
"As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter."
"The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined."
The mind is complex and multi-layered.
"Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage."
The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it.
"The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions."
"Wand out, Potter."
You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
I am going to break into your mind.
"Well, you stopped me eventually."
"Ideally, you should repel me with your mind."
"Clear your mind, Potter."
Abandon What was that?
"Realized what, Potter?"
What did you say?
"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
"Have you been practicing, Potter?"
"Well, we shall see, won't we?"
You just wait...
Semper--- I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
"Having fun, Potter?"
Been enjoying yourself?
"Amusing man, your father..."
"You will repeat what you saw to no You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
Now get out of my sight!
Do not set foot in this office ever again!
You wished to see me?
"Well, it appears that I cannot help you."
I have none.
"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you."
He sweeps from the office.
Umbridge is enraged.
"Run along, Wormtail."
"If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
"Put it down, Bella.  "
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.
"As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa."
"Your sister doubts me, Narcissa."
Understandable.
Over the years I have played my part well.  
So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  
But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  
To provide some... protection.
I can try.
Take out your wand.
I will.
I will.
I will.
It was his father's.
"It's alright, Mr. Filch.  "
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
What do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
Indeed.  
Your evidence?
You... just... know.  
"Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  "
How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
What's going on back here?
"You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen."
"Not so quick, Potter. ... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two."
"Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
From Professor Dumbledore.  
He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  
"You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes."
I'll escort him out.
I swore to protect you.  
"I made the Unbreakable Vow -- You're afraid, Draco.  "
"You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious."
Let me assist you -- Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  
That you take too much for granted?  
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
No!  
The Dark Lord was clear.  
The boy's to do it.  
"Go on, Draco."
Now!
No.
I gave my word.  
I made a vow...
Avada Kedavra!
You can no longer stay here.
Go on!
Go on!
Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
"You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  "
Yes.  
It's me.  
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
It will happen Saturday next.  
At nightfall.
#NAME?
This is a false trail.  
The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
To a safehouse.  
Likely the home of someone in the Order.  
I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible.
"Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  "
"We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  "
"As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour.
It has come to my attention that earlier this evening...
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise.
"We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable."
"Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls."
But know this.
"Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression."
"Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
Now then.
If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening...
I invite them to step forward now.
"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord."
In the last few hours alone -- There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself said it.
"Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure."
It answers to you and you only.
My Lord?
"With you, of course, my Lord."
My Lord -- Take them... Take them!
Please.
They are the same...
You have your mother's eyes...
Lily...
Then...
She's jealous.
Because she's ordinary and you're special.
It's true.
You know so yourself.
No!
Don't kill me!
Yes.
Only what I heard.
But now... he thinks it refers to her.
Yes!
But he thinks it's her son!
He intends to hunt them down now!
To kill them!
I have asked.
She's more than that!
She's different!
Beautiful.
Kind.
Anything.
You said you would keep her safe!
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord has gone --
No one can know.
Your word.
He exhibits no measurable talent.
His arrogance rivals even his father's.
And he seems to relish his fame.
You see what you want to see.
Why did you put it on?
Surely you realized it carried a curse.
Drink the rest.
It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
It will spread.
Maybe a year.
It is not expected that he will succeed.
You ask too much.
Tell him what?
"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment.
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Expecto Patronum!
Always...
We GO TO BLACK...
