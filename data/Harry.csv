"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
He's asleep!
Sorry about him.
"He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  "
Can you...hear me?  
It's just...I've never talked to a snake before.
Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  
"You're from Burma, aren't you?"
"Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  "
I see.
That's me as well.
"I never knew my parents, either."
Anytime.
Ow!
I swear I don't know!  
"One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone!"
It was like magic!
"Will I have to wear that, too?"
But that's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
"Hey, give it back!"
It's mine!
Because there's no post on Sunday?
Get off!
Ahh!
They're my letters!
Let go of me!
"Make a wish, Harry."
I-I am.
Thank you!
"Excuse me, who are you?"
"Sorry, no."
Learned what?
I-I'm a what?
"No, you've made a mistake."
I can't be...a-a wizard.
"I mean, I'm just..."
Harry.
Just Harry.
"Dear, Mr. Potter."
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
You knew?
You knew all along and you never told me?
Blown up?
You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Muggle?
Okay.
"First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  
"Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
But you like a dragon?
"All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad."
Could we find all this in London?
"Oh, nice to meet you."
Goodbye.
"But why am I famous, Hagrid?"
"All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?"
I haven't any money.
"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
"What's in there, Hagrid?"
I still need...a wand.
Hello?
Hello?
"Sorry, but what's curious?"
And...who owned that wand?
Wow.
"He killed my parents, didn't he?"
The one who gave me this.
"You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Maybe if you wrote it down?
Voldemort?
Me?
Voldemort tried to kill...me?
What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Platform 9&?
"But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake."
This says Platform 9&.
There's no such thing...is there?
"Excuse me, excuse me."
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9&?
Muggles?
Excuse me!
C-could you tell me how to-
"No, not at all."
I'm Harry.
Harry Potter.
The what?
Oh We'll take the lot!
Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
"These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
I got Dumbledore!
"Hey, he's gone!"
A little.
Yeah!
"Hey, Hagrid."
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Ahh!
"Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Wow.
"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
What's he teach?
I think she fancies you.
We got lost.
"I don't know, sir."
"I don't know, sir."
"Clearly, Hermione knows."
Since it's a pity not to ask her.
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Can I borrow this?  
Thanks.
"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  "
"Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken."
"The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day."
That's odd.
That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
Wow.
Neville!
"Give it here, Malfoy."
"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
"A century, according to McGonagall."
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?
I-I didn't know.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
Let's go this way.
Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Let's go.
Run!
Quick!
Let's hide though that door!
It's locked!
And for good reason.
Guarding something?
I think so.
What are those?
What is that?
I like this ball.
What do I do with it?
Whoa.
"I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
How could a troll get in?
Hermione!
She doesn't know!
It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
"Hermione, move!"
Whooa!
"Whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Do something!
Anything!
Hurry up!
I don't think so.
Just knocked out.  
Ew. Troll bogies.
"Well, what it is..."
Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
"Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
I'm not hungry.
That explains the blood.
"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog."
"But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults."
"He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.
But I-I never get mail.
It's a broomstick!
But who...?
A little.
What happened?
Yes!  
Whoa!
Yes!
Whoa!
Whooa!
Who knows?
Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Yes?
"But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
Exactly.
Nicholas Flamel?
Nicholas Flamel.  
Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Knight to E5.
"Happy Christmas, Ron.  "
What are you wearing?
I-I've got presents?
Your father left this in my possession before he died.
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.
It's some kind of cloak.
My body's gone!
I'm invisible?
There was no name.
It just said use it well.
Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Mum?  Dad?
Ron!
You've really got to see this!
Ron!
You've got to see this!  
"Ron, Ron, come on."
Get out of bed!
There's something you've got to see.
"Now, come on!"
Come on.
Come.
"Come look, it's my parents!"
Look in properly.
Go on.
Stand there.
There.
"You see them, don't you?"
Thats my dad
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.
No.
No.
"So, then it shows us what we want?"
Whatever we want?
"Hi, Hedwig."
Malfoy.
I found him!
Go on.
I knew the name sounded familiar.
I read it on the train that day.
The what?
Shh! Hagrid!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
We think Snape's trying to steal it.
"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone."
We just don't know why.
What?
Wait a minute.  
One of the teachers?
"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Norbert?
Malfoy.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.
I don't understand.
Is that bad?
50?!
"Hagrid, what's that?"
"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
"What is it, Fang?"
But what was that thing you saved me from?
But who would choose such a life?
Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
The Philosopher's Stone.
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.
Don't you see?
We had it wrong!
"Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
My scar.
It keeps burning.
Not like this.
I think it's a warning.
It means dangers coming.
Uhh!  
Oh.
Of course!
"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  "
"I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets?"
Why didn't I see it before?
"Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  "
What did he look like?
"The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
"We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
He's gone?!
Now?
But this is important!
It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Someone's going to try and steal it.
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
"It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
We go down the trapdoor.
Tonight.
Trevor.
"Now, Neville, listen."
We were Let's go.  
Sorry.
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.
We have to move its paw.
Come on!  
Okay.
Push!  
I'll go first.
Don't follow until I give you a sign.  
"If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Jump!
Go!
Whoa!  
Oh.
Ahh! Hermione!!
Hermione!
Where are you?!
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I'm fine.
Apparently not.
What?
"Ron, are you okay?"
Okay.
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
I don't know.
Sounds like wings.
"They're not birds, they're keys."
And I'll bet one of them fits that door.
I don't know.
Strange.
There!
I see it!  
The one with the broken wing!
It's too simple.
Catch the key!
Where are we?
A graveyard.
There's the door.
Wait a minute.
"No, Ron!"
No!
He's going to sacrifice himself!
RON!  
NO!
Don't move!
"Dont forget, we're still playing.  "
Checkmate.  
Take care of Ron.
"Then, go to the owlery."
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right...
I have to go on.
Not as good as you.
You?  
No.
I-it can't be.
"Snape, h-he was the one--"
"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
Snape was trying to save me?
Then-then you let the troll in.
I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the House Cup.
Voldemort.
Never!
You liar!
Admirers?
Ron was here?
Is he all right?
What about Hermione?
"But, what happened to the Stone?"
"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
"How is it I got the Stone, sir?"
"One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next... Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
What is it?
"All right there, Ron?"
All right.
Hermione?
One minute.
"Thanks, Hagrid."
"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts."
You know that.
I'm not going home.
Not really.
"I can't let you out, Hedwig."
I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school.
"Besides, if Uncle Vernon Now you've done it."
But she's bored!
If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends not one all summer.
"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
Who are you?
"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Why don't you sit down?
"Dobby, ssh!"
I'm sorry!
"I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
You can't have met many decent wizards then.
"Stop, Dobby!"
"Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!"
Stop!
"Stop, Dobby."
Please be quiet!
Are you all right?
Your family?
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?
Ok– I- understand.
You can't- say.
Dobby!
"Dobby, put the lamp down."
Give me the lamp!
Dobby stop!
"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
I- I was just-
Sorry.
"Yes, sir See why I've got to go back?"
I don't belong here.
"I belong in your world, at Hogwarts."
It's the only place I've got friends!
"Well, I expect they've been- hang on-"
how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
"Give me those, now!"
"Dobby, get back here!"
"Dobby, please, no!"
I can't.
Hogwarts is my home!
Ron! Fred.
George.
What are you all doing here?
Ahh-
ahh!
Let go of me!
Get off!
I think it's brilliant Hello.
W-what did I do?
Raids?
"Oh, sorry sir."
"I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
"Oh, it Oh,"
umm Floo powder? 'Diaganilly.'
"I'm fine, thank you."
I- I was just No!
Please!
Hagrid!
"I was lost, I- hang on."
"What were you doing down there, then?"
"Well, it's great to see you, too!"
I definitely need to remember that one.
Thank you.
Bye.
Voldemort killed my parents.
He was nothing more than a murderer.
Let's go.
Aah!
Sorry.
Lost-
lost control of the trolley.
Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock.
We've missed it!
Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
"Well come on, then."
Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.
Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Do you hear that?
Hold on Aaahhh!
Aaahhhh!
Aaahhh!
Wha-aahhh!
I'm trying.
Your hand's all sweaty.
I think we found the train.
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Ron!
Mind that tree!
Ahh!
Be thankful it's not your neck.
I don't know.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh! Aaaahhhh!
Come on!
Go!
Fast!
Ahh!
"See you, Hedwig."
"So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.
You're doomed.
Oh-
"Hi, Colin."
Nice to meet you.
Stop!
Stop!
Hold still!
Malfoy?
"No, Colin!"
Get out of the way!
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.
Ah!
Oh Okay.
Malfoy.
"He called Hermione, um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
What's a Mudblood?
That's horrible!
Not really.
What?
That voice.
Didn't you hear it?
Spooky.
Did you hear it?
That voice.
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just-
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.
Strange.
I've never seen spiders act like that.
"Oh, no It's Filch's cat."
It's Mrs. Norris.
No.
No.
"It's not true sir, I swear."
I never touched Mrs. Norris.
When I said I wasn't hungry.
We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Strange?
Do you think I should have told them?
"Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
"Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione."
"I mean, look at his family."
The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
"Well, how long will it take to make?"
A month?
"But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Wood!
Look out!
Thank you.
"No, I think my-"
I think my arm's broken.
"No, not you."
Ugh!
Uh!
Dobby?
It was you You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Your Bludger?
You made that Bludger chase after me?
"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Repeat itself?
You mean this has happened before?
"Dobby, stop it!"
Stop it!
"Stop, Dobby!"
"Tell me, Dobby."
When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?
"No, Dobby."
Tell me.
Who is it?
"Thank you, sir."
You wish.
Rictusempra!
Sya- hassa-
she.
Sya-
hasi- heth.
Sya- hasi- heth.
I'm a what?
I know.
"I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once."
"Uh, once!"
"But, so what?"
I bet loads of people here can do it.
What's bad?
If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
You were there!
You heard me!
I spoke a different language?
But- I didn't realize I-
how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
But I'm not I can't be.
I'll see you back in the common room.
No!
Mr. Filch!
Y-you-
you don't understand!
Professor I swear I didn't!
Professor Dumbledore?
I I-I
was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
You're wrong.
Professor!
"Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he-"
he just caught fire!
"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
"No, sir."
Nothing.
Crabbe and Goyle.
"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Wingardium leviosa.
Here they come.
Come on.
Let's get 'em.
Ughh!
Ron!
We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Excellent.
"Hermione, are you okay?"
Come on.
I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
I'm Ah- um Reading.
Uh-huh.
You're wrong!
Harry Potter?
But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
It's his stomachache.
Calm down.
Hair!
"Hermione, come out."
We've got loads to tell you!
Hermione? A- are you OK?
"She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls What's this?"
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Why would I throw something at you?
"But, who threw it at you, anyway? '"
Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
'My name is Harry Potter.'
'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?' 'Can you tell me?'
Excuse me.
Could you tell me what's going on here?
Are you Tom Riddle?
Dumbledore?
Hagrid!
Haagriid!
Woah!
It was Hagrid.
Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
"The monster had killed somebody, Ron."
What would any of us have done?
No! W-
"what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
And they found it.
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
No.
"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron."
"I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
What's that for?
"Hagrid, are you okay?"
Did you hear about Hermione?
"Look, we have to ask you something."
Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Look!
"Well, come on."
"Come on, Fang!"
You heard what Hagrid said Shush!
Come on!
Don't panic.
We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you?
Y-
y-you're
Aragog aren't you?
He's in trouble.
"Up at the school, there have been attacks."
They think it's Hagrid.
"They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Then you're not the monster.
Shush.
"But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
But have you seen it?
What?
"Well, thank you."
We'll justgo.
"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
Let's go!
Arania exumai!
Go!
Whoah!
Arania exumai!
Don't mention it.
Get us out of here.
Now!
Come on!
Come on!
Move faster!
Aah! Go on!
Go!
Get us in the air.
Come on!
Pull!
We know one thing.
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
He was innocent.
Wish you were here Hermione.
"We need you now, more than ever."
"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked."
Come on! '
"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk."
"Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye."
Spiders flee before it.'
"Ron, this is it."
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake!
Because no one did look it in the eye.
"Not directly, at least."
Colin saw it through his camera.
JustinJustin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Nick got the full blast of it-
but he's a ghost-
he couldn't die again.
And Hermionehad the mirror.
"I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
The water.
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
'Spiders flee before it.'
It all fits!
"Hermione's answered that, too."
"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago?"
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?
"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
At least we can tell him what we know.
"Professor, we have some information for you!"
Are you going somewhere?
You're running away?
After all that stuff you did in your books?
You wrote them!
You're a fraud!
You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Don't even think about it.
To ask you how you died.
Who was it Myrtle?
Just like that?
How?
This is it.
"This is it, Ron."
I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Hesha- Hassah.
"Oh, yes there is!"
You first.
All right.
Let's go.
Uhthanks Myrtle.
Aaah!
"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
This way.
It's a snakeskin.
"Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
I'll go on and find Ginny!
Hesha- Hassah.
Ginny Ginny!
"Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead."
Wake up.
Wake up!
"Please, wake up!"
Tom.
Tom Riddle!
"What do you mean, 'she won't wake?'"
She's not?
Are you a ghost?
She's cold as ice.
"Ginny, please don't be dead."
Wake up!
"You've got to help me, Tom."
There's a basilisk.
"Give me my wand, Tom."
"Listen, we've got to go!"
We've got to save her!
No.
She couldn't.
She wouldn't!
But why?
"But, why did you want to meet me?"
Hagrid's my friend!
"And you framed him, didn't you?"
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
"In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
You!
You're the Heir of Slytherin.
You're Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
He'll never be gone!
Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
Fawkes? Ginny-
Ginny Don't worry.
"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
"Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron."
"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
I just wasn't quick enough Of course!
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Thanks!
"It's alright, Ginny."
It's over.
It's just a memory.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"It's just You see, sir I-"
"I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
So the Sorting Hat was right!
I should be in Slytherin.
Because I asked it to.
Godric Gryffindor.
Dobby!
So this is your master!
The family you serve is the Malfoys Don't worry.
I will be.
"Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Mr. Malfoy!
Mr. Malfoy!
I have something of yours.
"Oh, I think you do, sir."
"I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Open it.
Just promise me something.
Never try to save my life again.
"Well, we had loads of help from you."
We couldn't have done it without you.
"Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
Nothing.
School stuff.
I will if she does.
Yes.
Okay.
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
That's a lie!
My dad wasn't a drunk!
Shut up!
Shut up!
No!
She deserved what she got!
Keep away from me.
Yeah?
Try me.
I don't care.
Anywhere's better than here.
I fell over.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Nothing.
I didn't.
The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
Who is that?
That man.
How did he escape?
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Hedwig.
"No, thank you."
Minister?
I don't understand.
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
"The state of things, sir?"
"Sirius Black, you mean?"
But what's he got to do with me?
Hedwig.
Egypt.
What's it like?
Mrs. Weasley.
Good to see you.
Yes.
"Yeah, it's all upstairs."
Everything's there.
Thank you.
Mr. Weasley.
"Yeah, sure."
Yeah.
It should be great.
"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Voldemort.
Sorry.
And kill me.
Mr. Weasley...
why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
I lost control.
I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Do you think he's really asleep?
I gotta tell you something.
Yeah.
"Thanks, Ron."
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Thank you.
What was that thing that came?
What happened to me?
And did either of you two...
you know... pass out?
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
How did he find out?
Fortuna Major.
Thank you.
She's still doing that after three years.
She can't even sing.
Exactly.
"Hey, man."
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God."
That's awful.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
What?
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Brilliant, professor."
At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could... Forget about it, guys."
See you later.
"Professor, can I ask you something?"
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Before I fainted...
I heard something.
A woman... screaming.
I think it was my mother...
the night she was murdered.
The most haunted building in Britain.
Yeah I know.
What's going on?
"Excuse me, sir."
Where's Professor Lupin?
"Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
"Oh, brilliant."
What happened?
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No.
"Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?"
"I mean, more than everyone else?"
"I'm scared, professor."
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made that dementor on the train go away.
But you made it go away.
"Guys, let me go."
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Let me go!
"Come on, guys."
Don't...
What are you doing?!
What's this rubbish?
Mr's.
"Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
No.
Is that really...?
So you mean this map shows...
Everyone?
Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
He was their friend... and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
"Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!"
"When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
I'm sure.
Expecto Patronum.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto... Expect...
That's one nasty dementor.
The first time I rode a broom.
There's another.
"It's not... happy, exactly."
"Well, it is."
It's the happiest I've ever felt...
but it's complicated.
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
I think I've had enough for today.
I was thinking of him.
And Mom.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
They're not sacking you!
You tell those spiders Ron.
Sorry.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
I was sleepwalking.
My dad didn't strut.
"And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
Spare bit of parchment.
Mr's.
"Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
No.
"No, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works."
"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
Someone I know to be dead.
Peter Pettigrew.
It's just what I saw.
"Good night, professor."
Hang on.
We better take this back.
Fine.
See you later.
Professor Trelawney...
Sorry?
No.
Nothing.
Why don't we just set him free?
Ow! Hagrid!
Hagrid.
It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
What?
Wait!
That's not good.
"Ron, run!"
Ron! Ron! Ron!
Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Don't worry.
I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
Come on.
Ron.
Then it'll be you!
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
You're the reason they're dead!
"Who was it, then?"
Expelliarmus!
Tell me about Peter.
No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
"The map was lying, then."
All they could find of Pettigrew was his... Show me.
"Give it to him, Ron."
No!
I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
"After that, the dementors can have you."
Okay.
No.
"Don't worry, okay?"
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You okay?
Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers.
"Besides, dead, the truth dies with him."
"Alive, you're free."
I know.
What?
Come and live with you?
Expelliarmus!
Come on.
Sirius!
Sirius!
No. Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
I saw my dad.
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
You mean they're gonna kill him?
It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
What just happened?
Where's Ron?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Hermione!
Hermione!
"Hermione, wait."
"Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
That's us.
This is not normal.
You mean we've gone back in time?
Good punch.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
That's Pettigrew.
He betrayed my parents.
You don't expect me to sit here.
Are you mad?
Ow!
Ow!
That hurt!
What?
Get away.
Get off.
This way.
Come on.
This way.
"This way, now."
Now what?
How?
And now we wait.
Yeah.
Hermione?
"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius..."
I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
He's asking me to come live with him.
"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'."
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country...
someplace you can see the sky.
I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Great!
Now he's coming for us.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius!
Come on!
Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now!
Right there!
You'll see!
"Don't worry, he will!"
He will come!
Sirius.
Expecto Patronum!
"You were right, Hermione."
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because...
"well, I had already done it."
Does that make sense?
I want to go with you.
But you're innocent.
My mother's eyes.
He's free.
We did it.
I don't know.
"Honestly, Ron."
How can somebody be in two places at once?
You've been sacked.
Resigned?
Why?
But Dumbledore...
None of it made any difference.
Pettigrew escaped.
What are you talking about?
For me?
But who sent it?
Hermione.
Bad dream.
When did you get here?
Last night.
Where are we actually going?
Yes sir.
This way.
Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
What's a 'portkey'?
Thanks.
See ya later Cedric.
I love magic.
When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
What is that?
Crime?
What crime?
"Those people tonight, in the masks..."
they're his too aren't they?
they're his followers.
There was a man.
Before.
There.
I dunno.
I didn't see his face.
It's alright I'll get it.
Oh no thank you
I'm not hungry.
I'm fine.
Well there's something you don't see every day.
I don't know
but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
Yeah well rather you than me.
No sir.
No sir.
Yes sir.
Let you know what?
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron.
Okay?
You're being stupid.
I didn't put my name in that cup.
I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be..
"Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
It's a broomcupboard.
"Oh, no."
I'm fourteen.
I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Fourteen.
No I didn't enter.
"Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
Sirius?
Sirius?!
How...
No!
I dunno.
No.
Umm..
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.
He wanted... me.
"I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me."
I mean it was only a dream right?
What are you saying?
Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Someone's coming!
Who says I was talking to anyone.
"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
Neville!
You're doing it again!
Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Is that right?
Well.... what?
Well you can tell Ronald...
Yeah I brought the cloak.
Hagrid where are we going?
What's with the flower?
Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Dragons?
That's the first task?
You're joking.
Ron was here?
No he didn't.
He didn't tell me a thing.
Thanks.
Excuse me..
Can I have a word?
Dragons.
That's the first task.
They've got one for each of us.
Yes.
Don't worry about it.
You're a right foul git you know that?
I know so.
Yeah.
Stay away from me.
I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy.
"He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
Oh...
um...
You know I just thought I'd...
Um...
I dunno..
I can fly.
I mean I'm a fair flyer.
But I'm not allowed a broom.
Yeah.
Battle a dragon.
The horntail... Nothing.
Who wants me to open it?
You want me to open it?
What the bloody hell was that?
Caught on have you.
Took you long enough.
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Who could possibly figure that out?
That's completely mental.
Well it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?
Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
Why do they always have to travel in packs?
How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
But then again he can take himself.
Agreed.
Cho!
Ok thanks.
Cho?
Um.  
I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
Um.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Ok.
Great.
Fine.
No problem.
Good.
What happened to you?
What did she say?
Don't be silly.
What did you do then?
Hey!
My dress robes.
Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Leave it alone.
Who?
Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Ready professor?
No.
Yeah she does.
What?
Really?
I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
What's that supposed to mean?
Cedric.
Spectacular.
Forget about it.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I must be out of my mind.
Myrtle! Polyjuice potion!
Kicked the habit.
"Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
Come seek us where our voices sound.
An hour long you'll have to look.
Potentially problematic?
When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Neville.
"No offense, but I really don't care about plants."
Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
You're sure about this Neville.
For an hour.
Most likely?
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking.
Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione.
Where are they anyway?
Do I?
But she's my friend too!
Hermione I finished last Hermione.
Mr Crouch?
I can come back later Professor.
Agh! Professor?
"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
It's just that I had a dream about him.
"It was in the summer, before school."
"In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
Yes.
Always the same one.
"Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
Yes sir.
Bubble juice sir?
I haven't stolen anything.
Fleur? Fleur!
No stop!
He's bewitched Cedric.
He's bewitched!
For a moment so did I. Some game.
"Together, on three."
"One, two, three!"
"Yeah, you?"
I've been here before.
I've been here before in a dream.
"Cedric, we have to get back to the cup?"
Now!
Get back to the cup!
Cedric!
Don't touch him.
Have it your way.
"He's back, he's back!"
Voldemort's back.
"Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back."
"I couldn't leave him, not there."
Not so much now.
The cup was a portkey.
Someone had bewitched it.
Who?
I dunno.
It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams.
One of my nightmares.
Um.
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the goblet of fire.
You bewitched Krum.
"But... That's Moody, but then who's...?"
"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment..."
um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
No I don't think so.
Yes.
Big D?
"Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
What?
"Shut up, Dudley."
I'm warning you...
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
"Not so brave now, are you Duddykins?"
Now tell your little friends to go away.
Don't you ever speak about that again.
You understand?
"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
Quiet!
Dudley!
Run!
Come on!
They break into a run.
A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them.
"Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
"Dudley, no! Lumos!"
"""Expecto Patronum!'"
"""Expecto Patronum! '"
Dementors.
No.
We were attacked.
They're evil.
"If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Because I used magic to save his Lumos!
What are you doing here?
How'd he know?
It just happened!
What's been going on?
What's Lord
Vol-
How are we getting there?
"Uh, is that very likely?"
Expecto--!
No!
But I can help!
Was that your--?
But...why here?
Mrs. Weasley!
Right.
"So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
Didn't you bother asking?
So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
You've still been here!
What's been going on?
What's this Order everyone's talking about?
Why?
Okay.
I'm not really hungry.
I think I'll go to bed.
"I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
Where's Voldemort?
What's he doing?
How?
And what's his plan?
And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
But...why?
"But you're telling people, right?"
What?
What kind of weapon?
"No, my scar kept hurting."
Yeah...nerves...
"Thanks, Hermione."
Bye.
Department of Mysteries?
I've been there before...
Er...sorry.
Yes.
"Yes, but-"
"Yes, but-"
Yes.
But I did it because of the Dementors!
My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors.
"That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
"I think so, yeah."
Er...is Percy mad at you?
What are you doing here?
"If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
Yeah...just...my scar...
the pain is getting stronger.
My parents.
"I miss them, Sirius..."
"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
Thanks.
Who..who was that?
I'm sure.
Nothing.
"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
What is that?
"Yes it is, it's right there!"
Er...you are?
"Well, thanks Luna."
Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
"Yeah, could be."
What?
Why?
What did I do?
Where'd she get that from?
"No one believes me, Hedwig."
No one...
I'm alone...
"Sorry, Professor..."
What good's theory in the real world?
What about Lord Voldemort?
It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead?"
Or are you calling me a murderer?
It was MURDER!
I saw it happen!
"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares."
Yeah.
But she called me a liar!
"Yes, Professor."
Oh!
Sorry...
"I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
"Later, I've got detention."
Thanks.
There's no ink.
"No, I haven't."
She is.
But the quill has some sort of spell on it.
It uses blood for ink.
"No, I'm telling anyone."
No!
I don't need his help.
I don't need anyone's help.
I've asked Sirius about it.
"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code."
"Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge."
My scar hurt again last night in detention.
"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
"Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he?"
She'd been sent here by the Ministry.
"Er... Where are we going, Hermione?"
"Hermione, what's going on?"
You mean about us teaching ourselves?
"Hey, Neville."
"Uh...same to you, Luna."
That's the first time you've said his name.
"It's okay, Hermione."
I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year.
Dumbledore's already told the school that.
If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
Me?
"Uh...well, yeah, I did."
That might work.
I'll look into that.
Yeah.
What's she done now?
"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded."
Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge.
No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor.
"Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
"Not only that, but what about the This isn't a coincidence."
She knows.
"Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
"What would we do without you, Hermione?"
Hedwig!
It's Hedwig.
I think she's been attacked.
London.
"Yes, Professor."
Dobby!
What are you doing here?
"What is it, Dobby."
"Don't worry about it, Dobby."
But I don't think you can help me.
"Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing.
Especially Professor Umbridge.
"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
"Better not, Dobby."
School is pretty intense right now.
"We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
"Just ignore them, Ron! Malfoy provoked us."
Ban us...for life.
You've--!
You can't!
"If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid."
Dumbledore said so last year.
So what did you do when you found them?
Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment.
Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
"Besides, it works."
I used it against You-Know-Who last June.
It saved my life.
Right.
"Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
"Well done, Neville!"
"Look here, you lot!"
Neville's really got the hang of this one.
"Never forget this spell, Neville."
It could save your live some day.
"Okay, everyone."
"We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement."
That's it for now.
"We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
"No, I saw it happen!"
I...
I was there...
Oh.
Uh...I was the snake.
I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Yes!
"What's that, Professor?"
Voldemort can read minds?
So he could read our minds right now?
But hasn't it helped so far?
"I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
What are you going to do?
No!
I've been there before...
I've just realized...
"What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
It's got to be.
Probably.
"Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too."
That must be what the Order's guarding!
They're all Death Eaters!
Voldemort.
"Professor, no!"
"I'm so sorry, Professor!"
Are you sure you can't?
Hagrid said it was important.
"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
Yeah.
No!
I--sorry!
"No, of course not!"
No--
"no, I've done all I can."
Voldemort!
He's got Sirius!
In the Department of Mysteries!
I just saw it.
How're we going to get there?
We've got to do something!
I won't let Sirius die!
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries.
He's got Sirius there!
"There isn't anyone else, Hermione!"
Everyone from the Order is gone!
"No, there isn't!"
How?
That's all we'll need.
Grimmauld Place!
Sirius!
Lupin?
Hello?
"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
"You know where he is, don't you?"
It's none of your business.
He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
You sent the Dementors?
"Hermione, no!"
I would rather die!
"Great plan, Hermione."
We've got no brooms.
What are those?
"All right, then."
"Get on one, and we'll be off."
"All right, come on."
Where is everyone?
That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
This is it.
Come on.
Stay close.
I don't understand.
"In my dream, Yeah."
I'll know the way when I see it.
Who's there?
Sirius?
Does anyone else hear that?
Sirius...
yeah...
Alohomora!
"Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it."
This is it!
Come on!
This is it.
This is where Sirius is!
He's in here somewhere.
What's my name doing here?
Why not?
It's got my name on it!
Where's Sirius?
What prophesy?
Go ahead.
Come and find out!
You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
"So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
Not really.
How come Voldemort wants it?
"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
What's so special about this What?
"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?"
Now!
Where'd the rest go?
Stupify!
Stupify!
Ron! Pretificus Totalus!
Hermione!
"Please don't be dead, please don't be dead..."
He shakes her.
Can we carry her?
I don't know...
What happened.
We need to get out of here.
"Luna, can you help Ginny?"
Let my friends go and I will.
"Stop, Neville!"
Are you all right?
You come with us!
Protego!
No...
no...
no....
I'LL
KILL you!!
Stupify! Crucio!
Can't.
It got smashed by accident!
How's Voldemort going to like that?
"You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
"He can't hear you from here, you know!"
Look out!
Professor!
No you don't!
You don't have a clue!
You can't possibly know!
I don't care!
I don't care!
Let me out.
You can't keep me in here!
I already know all this.
"Well, yeah,"
I did...
But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
"He barely taught me, though."
I always felt more open to it after the lessons.
Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-- Sirius didn't trust him.
Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
But I checked Grimmauld Place!
Kreacher said-- Why?
What?
"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Sirius hated him.
"Yeah, he really hated that place."
And you kept him locked up in there!
She never loved me.
I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
"I don't understand, Professor."
"Professor, why am I so important to Sir, it got smashed."
"I'm not sure I understand all that, sir..."
And...it means me?
"So it's not necessarily me, sir?"
What if he chose wrong?
Why didn't he wait?
Why attack when we were babies?
But I don't have any special powers.
"What is it, sir?"
One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
"Hey, Nick."
Oh.
Thanks.
"Nick, I was wondering about something?"
Expecting what?
I expect so...
Why?
How are you?
Better.
I've got something to tell you.
Something important.
But not right now.
I'm not ready.
Do you need any help looking?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it?
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Something worth fighting for Oh.  
Um.  
No one.  
Bit of a tosser.
Really.
Hey.  I was wondering...
I like riding round on the trains.
It takes my mind off... things.
"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
Can't imagine why...
"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
"My mother's eyes, yeah."
One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  
She's the best in our year.
"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
"It's alright, sir.  "
"I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse -- But, sir.  "
What about Hedwig?  
And there's my trunk -- Sir?
Really.
Didn't know.
Dumbledore.
When'd you get here?
Oh come on...
But we're talking about Hogwarts.
Dumbledore.
What could be safer?
Rubbish.  
He's only -- what?
Amazing.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Reckon he's right...
Good.  
Bad.  
Speaking of which...
Dunno.  
Let's get closer.
I don't know.  
I'm turned around.
What just happened?
"Don't you see, it was a ceremony."
An initiation.
It's happened.  
He's one of them.
So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  
Browsing for furniture?
Look.  
His father's a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.  
"Besides, Hermione saw it.  "
With her own eyes.
I need some air.
Luna.  
How'd you...?
"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
"I am your friend, Luna."
"Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."
Have you ever fixed one?  
A nose.
What the hell.  
Give it a go.
Well?  
How do I look?
Brilliant.
Later.  
What've I missed?
Thanks...
This can't be good.
"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor -- It is.  "
Or was.  
But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my Really?  
Well... brilliant.  
I'll head there straight away.
"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  "
You see -- Crush it.  
Don't cut it.
No.  
"Really -- Fine, sir."
"I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
Definitely.
Sir?
No!  
I mean...
she's brilliant.
And we're friends.  
But... no.
"Did you know, sir?  "
Then?
"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Do you want me to let him?
All right!  
Queue up!  
Excuse me... Thanks.  
All right.  
This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  
But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  
Is that clear?
All right.  
Cormac.  
Ron.  
It's down to you two for Keeper.  
We'll decide it with a shootout.
"Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  "
"Ginny, you'll take on Ron. Quiet!  "
I'm Captain.  
We do it my way.  
Now line up.  
On three. One.  Two... Three!
"C'mon, Ron... Ever heard of this spell?"
No.
It's... old.  
The binding is fragile.
I didn't say I wasn't curious.
"And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
The library.
And?
Good.  
That settles it then.
Who's up for a Butterbeer?
No.  
Over here.
"No, no.  Sit next to me."
"Hello, sir.  "
Wonderful to see you.
"So what brings you here, sir?"
"I'd consider it an honor, sir."
Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Dunno.  
But it must be important.
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
There's no time!
"She was cursed, wasn't she?  "
I know Katie.  
Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  
"If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
It was Malfoy.
I... just... know.
What does she see in him?
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
I suppose.
I don't know.  
She's smart.
Funny.  
Attractive...
You know.  
She's... got nice skin.
"Well, no.  "
I mean...
I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
I've never really thought about it.  
"But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
I think I'll be going to sleep now.
What?
"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
I think I'll be going.
"The shelf, sir?"
"I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
"You knew him, didn't you, sir?"
Tom Riddle.  
You were his teacher.
What was he like?
"I'm sorry, sir.  "
Forgive me.  
"He killed my parents, you see... Have it your way.  "
Juice?
Dunno what you're talking about.
Yep.  
Apparently it's his lucky day.
Yeah.  
"I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
Ah.  
Well... they're really good.
It feels like this.
Have you?
"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  "
As friends.
So who are you taking?
Really...?
But I am the Chosen One.
Okay.  Kidding.  
I'll just ask someone I like.  
Someone cool.
Neville...?
What're you doing?
And what's happened to you?
Cormac!  
That's who you invited!
I think she went to powder her nose.
Dragon balls.
"I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  "
My date...
A message...?
Traveling?  
Where?
Positive.  
Why?
"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
Lovely.
I'll take your word for it.
So what happens?  
If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  "
He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
I know it sounds mad -- That's not what it sounded like.
But Dumbledore can make mistakes.
He's said it himself --
I'm not --
It's good.
"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
Did you get my owl?
Go on.
A Vanishing Cabinet?
What happened to it?  
The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Soon.
"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  "
But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  
It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
You tell me.
Who could tell the difference?
I don't understand -- what happened?
But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Why?
"I don't know him that well, sir --"
"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  "
Something about a bit of rare magic...
I'm not sure...
"That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  "
But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?
"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  "
"What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  "
He might... misunderstand.
"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  "
When he came asking questions.
Sir -- Nice.
Hermione.  
I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
I've seen it.  
Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
The Map is never wrong.
Divine.  
"Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
Or twenty.
Really?  
"Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
Excuse me?
Well... Brilliant.
Bloody well hope so.  
She's been snogging you for three months.
Who're you talking about?
Okay.  
Very funny.
What the hell was that for?
Okay!  
Fine!  
You're in love with her!  
Have you ever actually met her!
"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  "
I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.
Devastatingly handsome.
Sir.  
I'm sorry.  
"I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely -- I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
"I'm sorry, sir.  "
About the other day.  
Our... misunderstanding.
"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  "
The questions.  
About... Voldemort.
"Yes, sir.  "
"It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  "
It seemed sensible.
Love potion.
Ron!  Ron!!!  
"Professor, help him!"
Professor!  
Do something!!
He's choking!!
Breathe!  
"C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  "
Breathe!  BREATHE!
"How are you, Katie?"
Sectumsempra!
The Room of Requirement...
Who showed you this?  
First.
What?
Oh.  
Yeah.
Say that again.
Excellent.  
Really excellent.
Right.  
I'm going down to Hagrid's.
No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  
"I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
Trust me.  
I know what I'm doing.
Or at least Felix does.
"Sorry, sir.  "
I should've announced myself.  
Cleared my throat.
Coughed.  
You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
"Just the general behavior, sir."
The sneaking around.  
The jumping when you saw me.  
"By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  "
He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  
"So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
Sir?
"Well, then by all means come along, sir."
"That would be counterproductive, sir."
No idea.
"A dead one, I think, sir."
Not to mention the pincers.
Through the front doors.
Oh yeah.
Do you know why I survived?  
The night I got this.
Because of her.  
Because she sacrificed herself.  
Because she refused to step aside.  
Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  "
And I'm not afraid of him.  
And you shouldn't be either.
She didn't just die for me that night.  
She died for you too.  
She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.
Professor.  
"I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  "
It's true.  
I am the Chosen One.
Only I can kill him.  
"But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago."
And I need to know what you told him.
"Be brave, Professor.  "
Be brave like my mother.  
Otherwise you disgrace her.  
Otherwise she died for nothing.  
"Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
"Sir -- Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  "
In making a Horcrux? Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  
But... what are they exactly?
Tom Riddle's diary -- And the ring...? ...
even more difficult to destroy.
But if you could find them all.
If you did destroy each Horcrux...
But how would you find them?  
"They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
"It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  "
When you leave the school.
"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
He was going to the Room of Requirement.
But I'm telling you.  
I saw it --
What if there are two?  
Vanishing cabinets.
I don't know...
I don't need luck.  
I'll be with Dumbledore.
"You look the same to me, sir."
"Yes, sir."
My word.
"Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
"It's there, isn't it?"
Sir!
"You should've let me, sir."
"We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
Accio Horcrux!
Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Professor...
there are bodies in this lake.
"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
"Why can't I drink it, sir?"
Professor?
Professor?  
Can you hear me?
You...
"you can't stop, Professor."
You've got to keep drinking.  
Like you said.  
Remember.
"It will, sir.  "
It'll stop.  
But only if you drink...
What?
No...
One more.  
Just one more.  
And then -- I promise...
I'll do what you say.
I promise.
"You did it, sir.  "
"Look -- I'm trying, sir.  "
"I'm -- Don't worry, sir.  "
We're nearly there.
"We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey -- All right.  "
Okay.
"Sir, are you... praying?"
Cruciatus!
Incacerata!
Impedimenta!
Fight!  
"Fight back, you coward!"
Sectumsempra!
Hagrid...
HAGRID!
Hagrid!  
You alright?
"Hagrid, Dumbledore -- Do you think he would've done it."
Draco?
No.  He was lowering his wand.  
"In the end, it was Snape.  "
It was always Snape.  
And I did nothing...
"Yeah, strange.  "
Only... it's not.
It's a fake.
Go on.  
Open it.
Dunno.  
"But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  "
"Which means, it was a waste.  "
All of it.
"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
I have to finish what Dumbledore started.
I'm not sure where that will lead me...
but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Yeah.  
I do.  
But do me a favor.
When I'm around?  
Keep the snogging to a minimum.
"Funny, he says the same about you."
You're brilliant.  
You both are.
I don't know.
I never realised how beautiful this place was.
Time for the teary farewell.
They'll torture you.  
Even Dudley.
"If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
Do you have any?  
Magic?
Absolutely not.  
"Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  "
"Isn't that right, Vernon?"
Well... thanks.
"See you, Big D. Good riddance."
"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
The Trace?
The real one...?
No!  
Absolutely not!
If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me -- This is different.  
Taking that.
Becoming me -- no.
"Blimey, Hermione!"
Yes?
Here.
Hagrid!  
We've got to help the others!
What was that?
Hagrid...
HAGRID...!
Is no one back yet?
Are you mad...?
A grindylow!
Who did this to him?
Hedwig -- I think.  
"She was trying to protect me -- I trust you with my life, Hagrid."
I trust everyone in this room.
Understood?
No one else is going to die.  
Not for me.
Come with me.  
Now.
Wedding?
I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is.
I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  
It's the only chance we have to beat him.  
And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Yes.
Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  
"If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  
Because of everything that's going on.
"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
And this would be...?
What's this all about?
No idea.
That's it then?
Excuse me?
"You'll forgive me, Minister.  "
But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days.
You mean --
But that's brilliant --
I... don't know what to say.
"No, 'course not.  "
"How are you, Luna?"
"Nice to meet you, sir."
Sir?  
May I sit down?
"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  "
I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?
"I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
"Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
"Strange, sir?"
"Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
Just curious.  
I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
Who are you talking about?
Who?
"Oh, right.  "
Slipped my mind...
Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Excuse me?  
You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  
Maybe we should -- Same.
My rucksack.  
With all my things.
I left it back at the Burrow --
You're joking.
Down!
Stupefy!
"Lock the door, get the lights."
This one's name is Rowle.  
He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
It's better we wipe their memories.  
"We kill them, they'll know we were here."
How is it they knew we were there?
Hermione.  
I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  
But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
I have an idea.
Mad-Eye...?
Lumos.
Yeah.  
They knew her.  
"She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  
She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  
I'm thinking maybe she could help us.
To the Dark Lord.  
I know I will be dead long before you read this...
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it... Stop!  
I order you!
"Been spying on us, have you?"
Ever seen this before?
"Kreacher, I own this place."
Sirius left it to me.  
Which means I own you too.
That's right.  
"But there were two, weren't there?"
Where's the other one?
Answer her.
How do you mean?
Where is it now?  
"Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
"Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
Find him.
You mean... it remembers me?
When you turned this place over -- don't deny it!
"-- you found a locket, am I right?"
Who was she?  
This witch?
It gets really tricky.
This is completely mental.
I'm nobody.
Apparently so.
Are those...?
The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
Ron.  
You don't have a wife.
"Look, we'll go with you -- Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  "
It's us you should be worrying about.
"I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  "
Deal?
Accio locket.
"Ron, it's me."
She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge -- Arthur!  
"You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
"No, Arthur.  "
It's a fact.  
They're watching you.
I'll tell you later.  
Let's find Hermione.
It's here...
You're lying.  
"And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores..."
Stupefy!
Expecto PATRONUM!
Accio Dittany.
Hermione.  
His arm -- What happened?  
I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Don't be stupid.
What're you doing?
Tent?  
Where am I supposed to find -- They're great.
No problem.
How bad is he?
Dumbledore had a theory.  
He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  
And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  
We know of three so far.  
"The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  "
"The diary, which belonged to Tom himself."
"And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
How d'you know?
I know.  
I felt it too.
"It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
That's why we're going to kill it.
Dissendium!
Expulso!
We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
No.
"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  "
"It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  "
Can you understand that?
He's found him.  
Vol-- You-Know-Who.  
He's found Gregorovitch --
Yes.  
How'd you know?
You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  
But he's desperate to have it.  
It's as if his life depends on it.
Well it sets my teeth on edge.
What's he expecting to hear?  
Good news?
And what gets you through the day?
How long before he can travel?
You're not doing enough.
Loads.
Snatchers.
Good to know your enchantments work.
We have to leave.  
We're not safe here.
Then we'll go by foot.
We're all hungry.
It'll be dark soon.  
We need to find a place to sleep.
My turn.
Maybe you could tell me now.
Brilliant.
O-kay.
With a basilisk fang.  
If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours -- It only takes in that which makes it stronger... ...
it can destroy Horcruxes.
"You're brilliant, Hermione."
Truly.
There's only one problem...
What's the problem?
"Look, don't be shy.  "
"If you've got something to say, spit it out."
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
I don't understand.  
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  
Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels?
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?
I've told you everything Dumbledore told me!
"And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
"Yeah, he would.  "
D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  
D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?
You think I don't listen!  
You think I don't know what it's like -- Go then.  
But leave that.
Salvio Hexia...
Protego Totalum...
You were right.  
It's like you said.  
Snitches have flesh memories.  
But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  
I almost swallowed it.
What do you reckon it means?
"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron-"
At Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Around his neck.  
Like an amulet.
I didn't think much of it at the time.  
You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  
I just figured it ran in the family.
"Hermione, I've been thinking.  "
I --
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.
"It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
"But it means something to him too, Hermione.  "
You-Know-Who nearly died there.  
Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?
"Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  "
"Obvious, isn't it?"
Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
Hermione...
No.  
This is where I was born.
I'm not returning as someone else.
Do you think they'd be in there?
My mum and dad?
Is it -- ?
No.
"Happy Christmas, Hermione."
Yeah.
C'mon.
We look like ordinary Muggles.
Relax.  
This is right.  
I know it.
"This is where they died, Hermione."
This is where he murdered them.
"You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore."
She might have the sword.
"Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  "
I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.
"She's gaga, remember?"
Here.  Let me do that.
Miss Bagshot?  
Who is this man?
His name.  
Can you tell me his name?
"This is him, Hermione.  "
The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
The thief.  
"Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
She wants us to go upstairs.
She wants me to go.  
Alone.
It's all right.  
You stay here.
Lumos.
Yes.
Yes.
We got away.
Are you alright?
You've outdone yourself this time.
Where are they?
"Who is he, Hermione?  "
The thief?
Did Dumbledore know him?
Well?
"Tell me, Hermione.  "
Who is he?
"Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
And Dumbledore believed in it? '
For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?
"We're young, Hermione.  "
"And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
Where's my wand?  
I'll take the watch.
Hermione.  
Where's my wand?
It's done.
It's done.
Leave me yours.  
You get back in the warm.  
And give me that.
No... Lumos!
Accio Sword.
Diffindo.
Hermione...
It was you!
And the doe.  
That was you as well.
My Patronus is a stag.
You didn't see anyone else?
"But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
See that?  
It knows.  
It's afraid.
Do it.
All the more reason.
Then why are you here?  
Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  
"When it does, don't hesitate.  "
"I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  "
The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.
On three.  One.  Two.  Three.
Take me inside...
"Stab it, Ron.  "
Now.
Don't listen to it.
Ron.  Don't listen to it!
Ron.  Stab it!
"We were better without you, happier without you."
Ron.  
It lies!  
Stab it!  
STAB IT!
Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
"After you left, she cried for a week.  "
She's like my sister.
You've sort of made up for it tonight.  
Getting the sword.
Finishing off the Horcrux.
That too.
Hermione!
Fine.  
Actually... more than fine.
Um... I don't know?
It's a long story.
It's a long story.
Exactly how did you find us?
It?
Knew what?
Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
Yeah... Engorgio.
Reducio!
Nothing.
Sorry?
Jesus.  
It was there too.
Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop.
on the alley wall...
"Not still mad at him, are you?"
Luna.
"Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  "
I'm Harry Potter.  
We met a few months back?
Would it be okay if we came in?
"It won't take long, sir.  "
I promise.
"Well, sir, we need some help."
What's going on here?
"Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  "
A symbol...
Yes!  Exactly.  
"What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
The what?
No.
Sorry...
I still don't really understand...
Which one would you choose if you could?  
Of the Deathly Hallows?
The Stone.
"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  "
Mad-Eye.
Dumbledore.  Sirius.  
Anybody.
But I have one.  
The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
"And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  "
It had a symbol on it.  
Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows.
Sir?
"Who took her, sir?"
They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  
He was just desperate.
They exist.  
The Hallows.
"But he only wants the one, the last one.  "
That's what he's been looking for.
"He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  "
He'll have it by the end of the night.  
He's found the Elder Wand.
Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
The list is wrong.  
I told you who I am -- What did you put on me?
How long will it last?
Luna?
Help us.
Dobby?
What are you doing here?
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?
"Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander-- Stupefy."
Stupefy!
Hermione.
You're all right.
We're safe.
We're all safe.
Dobby.
Dobby.
"No, just-- Hold on."
Hold on.
"Look, just hold on, okay?"
We'll fix you.
Hermione will have something.
In your bag.
Hermione?
Hermione?
What is it?
Help me.
I want to bury him.
Properly.
Without magic.
I need to talk to the goblin.
How are you?
You probably don't remember -- Yes.
Why did you leave Gringotts?
"Alone, yes."
"With you, no."
It's complicated.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need.
We didn't steal it.
And she never suspected?
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Then what?
The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there.
She kept asking you what else we'd taken.
I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there.
"If we find it, we can kill it."
"And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
I'm still working on that part.
"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
"Can you identify these, sir?"
And this?
Was?
Isn't it still?
"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
"But you, sir?"
Do you believe they exist?
You're lying.
You know one exists and you told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
"He has found it, sir."
"That's all, sir."
We'll leave you to get some rest now.
"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
I reckon you should take this then.
"If I can hold it, you can."
I'll know.
I can't explain.
It's like...
No.
I just know.
When one's near.
In the morning.
He'll be leaving too.
Yeah.
Funny.
"Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I -- Hogwarts?"
"It's not the place you left, you Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you."
Sirius gave it to me.
He had a matching piece.
"He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
Something like that.
I don't know.
He died before I ever got to use it.
The thing is...
"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
C'mon.
Let's do it.
Imperio.
How long before they come after us?
"What is that, Griphook?"
Griphook!
What is that!
Well done.
Hey. Lumos !
That's it.
Up there.
Give me the sword!
The real one.
"We have a deal, Griphook."
Griphook!
Griphook!
Come on!
We're dropping!
He knows.
I saw him.
"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
He's angry.
But he's scared too.
He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest.
There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked?"
"We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
We'll go to Hogsmeade.
To Honeydukes.
Take the secret passage in the cellar.
There's something wrong with him.
"In the past, I could always follow his thoughts."
Now everything feels disconnected.
No.
It's more like he's wounded.
"If anything, he feels more Expecto Patronum!"
You're Aberforth.
Dumbledore's brother.
It's you I've been seeing -- here.
It's He's dead.
Dung had no right selling you that.
It belonged to -- We need to get into Hogwarts.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
We've been hunting Horcruxes.
We think the last one's in the school.
But we'll need your help getting in.
"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all."
We need to get into Hogwarts tonight.
"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
Why should he...
I only care about the Dumbledore I knew.
I trusted him.
I had no reason not to -- You're drunk.
Where've you sent her?
"Neville, you look..."
The Carrows?
Okay.
"There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle."
It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.
We don't know.
I realize it's not much to go on.
I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw.
"It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable."
Any ideas?
Hey there.
"Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry."
"He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
I think I can help you out with that... -..
Harry appears.
And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood.
Tell them how it was that night.
"Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him."
Tell them!
I'm a Gryffindor.
Time.
As much as you can give me.
"Is that possible, Professor?"
I think you're right.
"You, too, Professor."
Okay.
But take this.
That way you can find me when you get back.
Ravenclaw Common Room.
Got to start somewhere.
"Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off."
"Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
"We'll talk later, Luna."
Later.
"Okay, Luna."
Who've you got in mind?
It's you...
"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
I'm sorry.
"It's Helena, isn't it?"
Helena Ravenclaw.
Rowena's daughter.
Luna told me.
Yes.
She thought you might be able to help me.
Yes!
That's right --
Wait!
Please!
But I don't care about its powers!
Honestly -- I don't seek it for myself!
You have to believe me!
I want to destroy it.
"That's what you want, isn't it, Helena?"
You want it destroyed.
"I'll end your pain, Helena."
Tell me where it is
"and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory -- Tom Riddle --"
He's lied to many people -- Thank you... -.. then turning...
Thank you... -.. then running.
Ginny!
Neville!
You alright?
Luna -- ?
I could ask you the same.
I remember.
What's wrong with the one you have?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix.
You knew it was me.
But you didn't say anything.
No.
I don't think so...
"Besides, its allegiance is to me now."
"If you want it, you'll have to win it back."
Perhaps even kill me...
Expelliarmus!
Well done.
Let's find Ron and get out of here.
Split up!
"No, it''ll just follow us!"
Here!
Take one!
Wait!
What about Malfoy and Blaise!
"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
He does.
It's the snake.
She's the last one.
The last Horcrux.
No.
He'll keep her close.
I know where he is.
Give me something!
Quickly!
A flask!
Anything.
I'm going there now.
It's... meant to be.
There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
I think I've known for awhile.
Kill the snake.
Kill the snake and then it's just him.
Then it will be over.
Why are you here?
All of you?
Does it hurt?
Dying?
I'm sorry.
I didn't want any of you to die for me.
"And Remus, your son..."
You'll stay with me?
He won't be able to see you?
Stay close to me.
You weren't.
"Sir, this, is this..."
"I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
Then...
I'm dead too?
Not?
But I didn't defend myself.
I let him kill me.
"It's true, isn't it, sir?"
"A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
And you knew this?
That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
"Professor, is that -- ?"
"Exactly where are we, sir?"
It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner.
And without the trains.
"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
"Sir -- You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest."
"I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
I've got a choice?
And where would it take me?
Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
And the snake lives.
And I've nothing to kill it with.
"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
"Which would be, sir?"
"Sir, my mother's Patronus."
"It was a doe, wasn't it?"
Just like Professor Snape's.
"Curious, don't you think?"
Professor.
Is this real?
Or has this been happening inside my head?
Confringo!
The snake!
We've got to kill the snake!
Because I have something worth living for.
Confringo!
You were right.
When you told Professor Snape it was failing you.
It will always fail you.
Together.
I told you: it's useless to you.
Because it answers to another.
"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his."
But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.
It answers to me.
"Well, it wasn't boring, was it?"
Together?
There's nothing scary about thestrals.
They're gentle things.
"Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages."
"You/'be going in the boats, remember?"
Yes?
Albus Severus Potter.
You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.
One of them was a Slytherin.
And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard.
"But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor."
The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Really.
Ready?
