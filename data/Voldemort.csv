Use the boy.
He lies.
Let me speak to him.
I have strength enough for this.
"Harry Potter, we meet again."
Yes.
You see what I've become?
See what I must do to survive?
"Live off another, a mere parasite."
"Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own."
"But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
Stop him.  
Don't be a fool!
Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Haha.
Bravery.
Your parents had it too.
"Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again?"
"Together, we can bring them back.  "
All I ask for is something in return.  
"That's it, Harry."
There is no good and evil.
"There is only power, and those too weak to seek it."
"Together, we'll do extraordinary things."
Just give me the stone!
Kill him!
Fool!
Get the stone!
NO!
"The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say."
Good.
"First, gather our old comrades."
Send them a sign.
Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Let me see it again.
"Ah yes, the time is close now."
Harry!
At last!
Step aside Wormtail
so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
Kill the spare.
"Do it, now!"
My wand Wormtail.
Hold out your arm.
The other arm Wormtail.
Welcome my friends.
"Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday."
"I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
"Not even you, Lucius."
"There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
"Out of fear, not loyalty."
Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.
"Oh, such a handsome boy."
Harry!
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
Standing on the bones of my father.
I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
The boy who lived.
How lies have fed your legend Harry.
Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago?
Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
It was love.
You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch you.
"It was old magic, something I should have forseen."
"But no matter, no matter."
"Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry?
Pick up your wand Potter.
"I said pick it up, get up."
Get up!
You've been taught how to duel I presume yes?
First we bow to each other.
"Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he?"
I said bow!
That's better.
And now...
"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud."
Especially your filthy mongrel mother.
"I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you."
After tonight no one will ever again question my powers.
"After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged."
Get up.
Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter
"I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
Do nothing.
He is mine to finish.
He's mine!
No!
"Bow to death, Harry... Can you reach it?"
"Can you take it for me, Black?"
"Oh, you will die."
Eventually.
"But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then."
"I'm going to enjoy this, Black."
"I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon."
And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way!
"Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh."
"So, you smashed my prophesy..."
"I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!"
Avada Kadavra!
"It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!"
Avada Kedavra!
"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?"
There is nothing worse than death!
Severus.  
I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  
Come.  
I've saved you a seat.
"You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  "
Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  
"Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  "
"Are you, Lucius?"
Are you burdened?
"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
"And this information comes -- Pius, what say you?"
Spoken like a true politician.
"You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  "
Where will he be taken?  
The boy?
Wormtail!  
Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  "
But I face an unfortunate complication.  
It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core.
"They are, in some ways, twins.  "
We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  
"Which means, if I am to kill him..."
I will have to do it with another's wand.
Come now.  
Surely one of you would like the honor?  
"What about... you, Lucius?"
I require your wand.
Do I detect elm?
And the core?
My wand?  
You can't possibly think I would give you my wand.
"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  "
Her specialty was Muggle studies.
It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.
"She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  "
"To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  "
"I, of course, take a contrary view.  "
But we're all civilized here.  
All adults.  
We can agree to disagree.
Avada Kedavra!
Nagini... Dinner.
Avada...
Then explain this!
"Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  "
I won't be so forgiving next time...
"You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  "
"Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
Who was he?  
The thief?
I believe you...
I have seen your heart and it is mine...
"If not you, then who?"
"Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  "
Tell me who possesses it!  
"The name, Grindelwald!  "
The name!
"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini."
We must find out just how much he knows.
We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.
I know that many of you will want to fight.
Some of you may even think this wise.
But this is foily.
I wish you no harm.
TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts.
I was once one myself after all.
I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
Give me Harry Potter.
Do this and none shall be harmed.
Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
They never learn.
Such a pity.
Begin.
Nagini.
Come.
Stop looking at her.
She smells your fear.
It agitates her.
Be grateful she's just eaten.
I do not need to seek the boy!
"Before the night is out, he will come to me!"
Do you understand!
"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go."
Find Severus.
Tell him I need to see him immediately.
Why doesn't it work for me?
No!
I am extraordinary!
But the wand resists me!
Does it?
The wand.
Does it truly answer to me?
"You're a clever man, Severus."
Surely you must know.
"Where, Severus?"
Where does its loyalty lie?
"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner."
Ollivander was quite explicit about that.
"You killed Dumbledore, Severus."
"While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine."
"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
But only I can live forever...
Kill. Nagini!
Come!
You have fought valiantly... but in vain.
I do not wish this.
Every drop of magical bliood I therefore command my forces to retreat.
"In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity."
Treat your injured.
I thought he would come.
"I was, it seems... mistaken."
Harry Potter.
The Boy Who Lived.
Come to die.
Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters.
Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises I do not require assistance.
"Behold, Nagini."
Our work is done.
Stupid girl.
You cry for that?
"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only."
"While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees."
"While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's."
So do not cry for that.
He's not worthy of your tears.
And do not despair of his betrayal.
You were never in his heart.
Not for one single solitary beat.
Did you not hear me!
Harry Potter is dead!
"From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences."
HARRY POTTER Is Now is the time to declare yourself.
"Well done, Draco."
Who will be next?
Hm?
"Come now, don't be shy."
"Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better."
Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?
"Who might you be, young man?"
"Well, welcome, Neville."
I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.
"Now, now, Bellatrix."
Let's not underestimate our young friend.
"By stepping forward, he lives to see another day..."
"Very well, Neville."
I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.
Nagini!
With me!
Leave her!
I said LEAVE HER!
Nagini Die!
Die Why do you live!
It belongs to me!
I killed Snape!
