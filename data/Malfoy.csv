"It's true then, what they're saying on the train."
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  
This is Crabbe and Goyle.
And I'm Malfoy...
Draco Malfoy.  
"Think my name's funny, do you?"
No need to ask yours.
"Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe?"
You must be a Weasley.
"Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter."
Don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
I can help you there.
Up!
Did you see his face?
"Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
No.
I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  
How 'bout up on the roof?  
"What's the matter, Potter?"
Bit beyond your reach?
Is that so?  
"Have it your way, then!"
Wingardium Levio-saaa.
No!
"Excuse me, Professor."
Perhaps I heard you wrong.
"I thought you said...""the four of us."""
The forest?
I thought that was a joke!
We can't go in there.
Students aren't allowed.
And there are......werewolves!
Okay.
Then I get Fang!
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.
"Scared, Potter?!  "
Did you hear that?
"Come on, Fang."
Scared.
HELP!!!!!
"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you,"
Potter?
Famous Harry Potter!
Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
"Oh look, Potter."
You've got yourself a girlfriend.
See you at school.
That's right.
And that's not all that new this year.
"You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
"Ha, ha!"
"Ha, ha 'Enemies of the heir beware!'"
"You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
"All right there, Scarhead?"
"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
"You'll never catch me, Potter!"
"Uhh, uhhh Scared, Potter?"
Everte statium!
Serpensortia!
"Crabbe, Goyle!"
Where have you two been?
Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
Why are you wearing glasses?
Reading?
I didn't know you could read.
"And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
"Well, sit down."
"You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave."
They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world.
All of them.
"What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
"You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks."
I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
What?
You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
"Good one, Goyle."
You're absolutely right.
Saint Potter.
And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!
You know I don't Goyle.
I told you yesterday.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Is this yours?
But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened.
He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled.
"The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died."
"So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time."
"As for me, I hope it's Granger."
What's the matter with you two?
You're acting veryodd.
Hey!
Where are you going?
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
"I mean, you actually fainted?"
Exactly how do we do that?
"Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
"Oh, yeah."
Terribly funny.
Really Witty.
"God, this place has gone to the dogs."
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
D-Dementor!
Dementor!
"Oh, please."
"Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
It's killed me!
It's killed me!
Oh You're gonna regret this.
You and your bloody chicken!
It comes and it goes.
"Still, I consider myself lucky."
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.
I couldn't do homework for weeks.
This class is ridiculous.
"Well, well."
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
"Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?"
Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?
"Uh, Not very friendly."
"Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
Don't stand there!
Do something!
Get out of the way!
Move!
Now I'll tell you.
Father said...
I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
Look who's here.
Come to see the show?
"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
"Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself."
Why so tense Potter?
My father and I have a bet you see.
I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last My father will hear about this!
"I should thank you, Weasley."
You're definitely our best player!
"Bet you loved that, Potter!"
"Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?"
I've never seen a worse Keeper!
Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song.
About his filthy mother!
And his pathetic loser of a father too!
"But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you?"
How can you stand the stink?
I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
"God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled."
Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long.
That's for speaking to me.
"You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!"
"You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
What just happened?  
Blaise?
Hogwarts.  
What a pathetic excuse for a school.  
I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
"Amused, Blaise?  "
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.
You two go on.  
I want to check something.
"Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter?"
Petrificus Totalus!
"Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin."
Enjoy the ride back to London.
"It's a not a cane, you cretin."
It's a walking stick.
Is my father's.  
He's not dead.
"Nice face, Potter."
"Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!"
"Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing."
Happy?
Certainly...
Professor.
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't.  
What's it to you?
I don't need protection.  
I was chosen for this!  
Out of all others.  
Me!  
And I won't fail him.
No!  I was chosen.  
This is my moment!
Cruci-- Don't touch me!  
Don't you dare touch me!
Who else is here?  
I heard you talking.
How do you know what I am?  
I've done things that would shock you.
He trusts me!  
I was chosen!
Expelliarumus!
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it.
In Borgin & Burkes.  
They form -- I don't want your help!  
Don't you see!  
I have to do it!  
I have to!
I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
I can't be sure.
What's wrong with his face?
Take my hand.
"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter?"
Harry looks slowly over his shoulder.
"Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light."
He holds a wand on Harry.
I virtually lived here last year.
Remember?
Easy.
Give me my wand.
Potter!
Harry turns.
Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand.
Ron GRINS.
