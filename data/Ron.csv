"Excuse me, do you mind?"
Everywhere else is full.
"I'm Ron, by the way."
Ron Weasley.
So-so it's true?
"I mean, do you really have the...the... Scar...?"
Wicked.
"No, thanks, I'm all set."
Whoa!
They mean every flavour!
"There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe."
George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
It's just a spell.
"Besides, it's the cards you want."
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.
I got about 500 meself.  
Watch it!  
"Oh, that's rotten luck."
They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
I got about 6 of him.
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  "
"This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow.
Want to see?
Ahem.
Sun-
No.
"Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
I'm...Ron Weasley.
Whoaa!
Wicked.
"Mental that one, I'm telling you."
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
"Harry, what is it?"
Ahh!
I know you!
You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Ahh!
"Look at that one, Harry!"
"Whew, we made it."
Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?
That was bloody brilliant.
Turn it into rum.
"Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before- Ah."
Mail's here!
Up!!  
"Ooh!  Shut up,"
Harry. Seeker?
But first years never make their house teams!
You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
"Fred and George are on the team, too."
Beaters.
"Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great."
Best game there is!
"And you'll be great, too!"
Whoa.
"Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
"I'm telling you, it's spooky."
She knows more about you than you do.
Ahh!
Before the staircase moves again.
It's Filch's cat!
"That's it, we're done for!"
Alohomora?
Probably thinks this door's locked.
What do they think they're doing??
Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.
"Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
She needs to sort out her priorities!
Wingardrium Leviosar!
You do it then if you're so clever.
"Go on, go on."
"It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  "
"She's a nightmare, honestly."
No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
Not by itself.
Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.  
What?
I think the troll's left the dungeon!
"Hey, pea brain!"
Ew.
What?
Wingardium Leviosa!  
Cool.
"Well, what it is... Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
What are friends for?
"Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
Let's open it.
"Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  "
It's a Nimbus 2000!
Yay!
Jinxing the broom?
What do we do?
"Come on, Hermione!"
Go!
Fluffy?
Queen to E5.
That's wizard's chess.  
I see you've packed.
"Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie."
He's studying dragons there.
We've looked a hundred times.
I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Harry wake up!
"Come on Harry, wake up!"
"Happy Christmas, Harry."
Oh.
My mum made it.  
It looks like you've got one too.
Yeah!
There they are.
What is it?
"Well, let's see then, put it on."
Whoa!
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak.
They're really rare.  
I wonder who gave it to you?
Why?
I only see me.
That's me!
"Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup!"
"And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too!"
I look good.
"Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
I'll be right back.  
Want to play chess?
We go and visit Hagrid?
"Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't."
There's something not quite right about that mirror.
I'm ready!
Ask me any question.
...
I forgot.
Copy off you?
That's insulting!
It's as if they don't trust us!  
Dumbledore again!
Leg-Locker Curse?
"You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945 -for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!"
This is light?
The what?
Immortal?
I know what it means!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
I know what that is!
"But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback!
My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
It's crazy.
"And worse, Malfoy knows."
It's bad.
Okay.
"But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Speak for yourself.
"All right there, Harry?"
Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Trevor shh!
"Go, you shouldn't be here!"
You're a little scary sometimes...you know that?
"Brilliant, but scary."
"It's for your own good, you know."
Sorry.
Wait a minute...he's....
Sleeping.
Uh.
It's got horrible breath!
What?!
Ew! Yuck!
Ugh.
Ahh!  Whoa.
"Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
Kill us faster?!
"Oh, now I can relax!"
Hermione!!
Now what are we gonna do?!
Ahh!
Harry!
Harry! Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Ahhh!
Yeah.
Whew.
Lucky we didn't panic!
Alohomora!  
"Well, it was worth a try."
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.
"Oh, go on, Harry!"
"If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can!"
You're the youngest seeker in a century!
This complicates things a bit!
Hurry up!
This is no graveyard.  
It's a chessboard.
"It's obvious, isn't it?"
We've got to play our way across the room.
All right.
"Harry, you take the Bishop's square."
"Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle."
"As for me, I'll be a knight."
"Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
You there! D-5!  
"Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
Castle to E-4!
Smash!
Ron: Pawn to C-3!
Smash! Boom!
"The Queen turns, and smashes a piece!"
"Harry, Ron and Hermione wince."
The Queen turns again.
Both Ron and Harry study the game.
"You understand right, Harry."
"Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
Do you want to stop Snape or not?
"Harry, it's you that has to go on."
I know it.
"Not me, not Hermione, you.  "
Knight...to H-3.
Check.
Ahhhh!
All right?
You?
"Rescuing you, of course."
"Now, come on."
Get your trunk!
You'd better stand back.
Let's go!
Come on.
"Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
I've got you Harry! Drive!
Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
"It's not much, but it's home."
"They were starving him, Mum."
There were bars on his window!
Ginny.
She's been talking about you all summer.
A bit annoying really.
"Morning, Dad."
"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office."
"Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
"Oh, it He's always doing that."
"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum. Diagon Alley!"
Mum fancies him.
Whao!
I don't know.
The gateway's sealed its self for some reason.
"Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
"The car Uh, right."
Okay.
Oh no!
The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
Okay.
We can't be far behind.
We must be gettin' close.
Aaahhh!
Aaahhhh!
Aaahhh!
Harry!
Hold on!
Take my hand!
Hold on!
Yeah.
Welcome home.
It's not working!
Ahhhh!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Huh Aahh!
Ahh-ha-ha!
My wand!
Look at my wand!
What's happening?
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahhhh!
Ahh!
Aaaahhhh!
Ahh!
"Scabbers, you OK?"
The car!
Dad's gonna kill me.
"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
"Huhh Say it, I'm doomed."
Bloody bird's a menace.
"Oh, no!"
What do we do now?
Uh-oh.
I smell trouble.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones!
How did you get those?
"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy."
Eat slugs!
It's disgusting.
Hear what?
Kill?
I don't like spiders What's that?
Are you mad?
Ahem.
Vera verto!
Three guesses who.
D'you think it's true?
D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Let's think.
Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Of course.
You heard him! '
"You'll be next Mudbloods,' Crabbe and Goyle must know."
Maybe we could trick them into telling.
"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Wicked!
Malfoy'll tell us anything.
I'll stop it.
Of course.
Don't you see?
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Enlighten me.
"Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory?"
Don't you think we'll get caught?
Why?
Who?
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Who cares?
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?
"Oh, that's what you said to it!"
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language?
Exactly!
"Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
How?
Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Ahem
Yeah.
Right.
How thick could you get?
Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Uh Harry?
Bloody hell!
Uh Bloody hell.
But where's Hermione?
Okay.
What are you doing d-
"uh, I mean What are you doing down here?"
Uhh AhemStomachache.
S-
scar.
That was close!
Look at your tail!
Have you spoken to Hermione?
Yuck!
"But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you."
"I mean, it'll just go right through you."
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
"He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
That'll be a cheerful visit!
"Hello, Hagrid!"
"Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?‚Äù"
No!
"Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Hermione!
But you heard McGonagall!
We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
That's Dad's boss!
"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Hagrid's right!
"With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
What?!
They're headed to the Dark Forest!
Why spiders!
Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?‚Äù
"Harry, I don't like this Harry, I don't like this at all!"
Can we go back now?
Harry.
Harry! Ahh-
hhh
Can we panic now?
Know any spells?
Where's Hermione when you need her?
Whoah!
Glad we're out of there!
Ah- Aaaah!
Thanks for that.
Aah!
The flying gear's jammed!
I'm trying!
Follow the spiders!
Follow the spiders!
"If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him!"
"I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?"
What have we found out?
What's that?
"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
And Mrs. Norris?
"I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
But how's a basilisk been getting around?
A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Pipes?
It's using the plumbing!
Moaning Myrtle.
Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.'
Ginny What about my sister?!
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!
You can't go now!
Is there anything you can do?
Say something.
"Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Better you than us.
Aaah!
Ugh!
Go on.
What's this?
Bloody hell.
Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more!
"Heart of a lion, this one."
Harry!
Harry!
I'm fine!
UmRon Weasley.
Lockhart's memory charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is!
No!
What'll do I do now?
OK.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"Thanks, sir!"
"Uhh-um Welcome back, Hermione."
"I'm warning you, Hermione."
"Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
A cat?
Is that what they told you?
Looks more like a pig with hair.
Harry.
Brilliant.
"Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
Along with the dung beetle.
I haven't shown anyone.
Brilliant.
I still think it was brilliant.
Who do you think that is?
Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
Oh.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
Sure.
"Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
What's going on?
There's something moving out there.
I think...
someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
"Well, you sort of went rigid."
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
No.
"I felt weird, though."
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
"Shove off, Malfoy. ."
Green.
That's a monkey.
What is that?
You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
"Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
I will.
"Oh, don't try one of them."
"Oh, no."
Look at him.
His face.
Where did you come from?
Sure.
"Oh, yeah."
Um...
"Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross."
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
"So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
You're supposed to stroke it.
"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
"That was wicked, Harry!"
Listen to the idiot.
"He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
Who?
When did she get here?
Riddikulus!
"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop."
We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though.
You heard it's the most...
Probably Neville forgotten the password again.
"Oh, you're there."
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
Werewolves?
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
"He's got a point, you know."
"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
"Well, you fell off your broom."
There's something else you should know too.
"When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and..."
Well... Twice.
To the Shrieking Shack?
"Actually, I'm fine here."
"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
"What's up, Malfoy?"
Lost your skis?
"Bloody hell, Harry."
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
That's not true!
Thick heads.
Gorgeous.
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
I haven't lost anything!
Your cat killed him!
"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about."
And Scabbers is gone.
Your cat killed him!
Did.
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
I don't wanna tap-dance!
"Right, yeah."
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
"She's gone mental, Hermione has."
"I mean, not that she wasn't always mental..."
but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
I'm not going back.
See you.
It just got worse.
"Hermione, no!"
He's not worth it.
"Not good, brilliant!"
Scabbers!
You're alive!
Right.
"Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
Let's go!
"Oh, no."
He bit me!
Scabbers!
"Scabbers, come back!"
"Scabbers, you bit me!"
"Harry, Hermione, run!"
It's the Grim!
Harry!
Help!
Harry it's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
Harry!
What did you just do?
Me?!
He's mental!
Scabbers has been in my family for...
So what?
What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
You better go.
I'm fine.
Go.
So painful.
They might chop it.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
It's Scabbers who did it.
"He's my rat, sir."
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
But then they gave him an owl...
What the bloody hell was that all about?
"Hermione, no!"
He's not worth it.
"Not good, brilliant."
"Scabbers, you're alive!"
Let's go.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
"Stand back, I said!"
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Quiet.
Let the man through.
"I didn't mean to open it, Harry."
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
No one knows.
Bloody hell.
Don't know.
Hey Dad!
Where are we going?
"Blimey Dad, how far up are we?"
Krum!!!
There's no one like Krum.
He's like a bird the way he rides the wind.
"He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."
Been looking for you for ages.
Thought we lost you.
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
"On second thought, just the drewbals."
"Just the drewbals, thanks."
"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much."
Happened right under their noses.
"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
He was a catcher.
Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him.
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
Yes...
"Well, my dad did tell me about one..."
The imperious curse.
Brilliant isn't he!
Completely demented of course.
"Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know."
"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it?"
In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
How did you do it?
Never mind.
Doesn't matter.
You could have let your best friend know though.
You know bloody well what.
"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley..."
Harry Potter's stupid friend.
Piss off.
Who you talking to?
I heard voices.
You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
You think so?
Anything else?
Fine.
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it.
Everyone was saying it behind your back.
At least I warned you about the dragons.
"Oh no no, I did."
Don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.
"Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along."
"I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out."
Yeah it is isn't it.
Suppose I was a bit distraught.
Thank you Nigel.
Not now Nigel.
Later.
Go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh look mum's sent me something.
Mum sent me a dress??
Ginny these must be for you.
What are you on about?
Dress robes?
for what?
Something's about to burst out of Hilary
but I don't think it's a swan.
Where?
"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons."
If you can't get a date who can?
This is mad.
At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
"Well, us and Neville!"
Now I'm really depressed.
"Well Hermione, you're a girl."
Come on.
It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.
For a girl it's just sad.
Bloody hell.
Look.
We've just got to grit our teeth and do it.
"Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners."
Agreed?
There she was walking by.
You know I like it when they walk.
"I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
What else?
I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this Harry.
I don't know what got into me.
Bloody hell.
What are those??
Well they're alright.
"No lace, no dodgy little collar."
Traditional??
They're ancient!
I look like my great aunt Tessie.
I smell like my great aunt Tessie.
Murder me Harry.
"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out."
Hermione of course.
"Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
Because nobody asked her.
I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
No.
Absolutely not.
"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternising with the enemy.
"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind."
No.
He's using you.
Doubt it.
He's way too old.
Yeah that is what I think.
Go on.
Well that's completely off the point.
Harry...
They get scary when they get older.
Well...
yeah...
a bit Merci.
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
We're still misfits.
Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
Well I won't.
You know I won't!
"Let him breathe, Hermione!"
"Good to see you, mate."
"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted."
There is an awkward silence.
He thought you would be safest there.
"We've only seen him twice, and not for very long."
He's really busy.
"It's not that fun, mate."
Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
"We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings."
But we do know a few things.
What does he get a hug for?
"Oh, sure, that's why."
Me?
Jealous?
"Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all..."
"Come on, lets go back downstairs!"
What if he were still on his...
What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
You reckon she's here to spy on us?
"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
Harry!
I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts!
I'm on the team!
Harry--bloody hell!
You said she was making you do lines!
Always knew she was a bit fishy.
"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone
and he still couldn't kill you!
She can't!
Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
She doesn't look very good.
I'm going to resign.
I'm horrible!
I should never have joined.
This is the worst day of my life.
"Come off it, Hagrid!"
We're not blind!
A month?
So...no giants are coming?
Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Get McGonagall!
Go!
Harry! HARRY!
So you're saying this weapon You-
Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
But why the Department of Mysteries?
Bloody hell!
No way.
Quidditch practice.
"If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad."
You all right?
To the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah.
They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
"Shut up, Malfoy!"
Stupify!
That's just what we were wondering.
"So, how do we get to the Ministry?"
What are what?
And what about those of us who can't see them?
Luna comes over to them.
Never again...
"What do you mean, people?"
"Harry, have you seen this?"
Er...it's got your name on it.
"Hiyya, Harry."
"Good as new, mate."
Yeah ?
Harry?  
Did someone say Harry? '
Course not.  
"Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?"
Harry!
You've a bit of...
Mum sort of lost it last week.
Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  
That it's too dangerous.
"Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  "
"Took a day or two, but she came round."
A hundred and fifty.  
Give or take a few years.
How much for this?
How much for me?
But I'm your brother!
C'mon.
Let's go.
Hi.
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
Is it just me?  
Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
What're they playing at?
Hey.  Where's Hermione?
"Harry, where is she?"
Bloody hell.
One of what?
You're barking.  
What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
It's a creepy shop.  
He's a creepy bloke.
Probably on the platform.  
C'mon.
Don' you worry.  
He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
"Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic."
Looks like his own this time.
"Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  "
"First Years seemed to enjoy it, though."
Wankers.
Filch give you the wand outside?
That was cheerful.
But I don't want to take Potions!
"Ron Weasley, sir.  "
"But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going -- Hard feelings?"
Really?  
"Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  "
"Keeper needs to be agile, quick -- Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  "
Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  "
Cormac.
Not bloody likely.  
He's top of the class.  
"Even better than you, Hermione.  "
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
What?
The who?
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it's true.  "
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  
Now you're always reading that bloody book.  
It's like being with Hermione.
The library.
Spider?  About six feet tall?  
Ten feet wide?
Barking.  
Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us?
What?
O-kay.
"Aw, bloody hell..."
I'd like to leave.
That happens to be my sister.
What're you playing at?
Get to know him?
Um...
You've got a little...
Bit worried about her.  
Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  
Her and me snogging.  
Ha.  
As if...
"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue -- Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years."
What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  
Ginny.
Dean?  
He's brilliant.
"Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  "
Something snaps.  
You've got to hate him.  
"You know, on principle."
So what is it?  
He sees in her?
Attractive?
Skin?  
You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Hermione's got nice skin.
Wouldn't you say?  
"As skin goes, I mean."
Right.
So.  
How was it?
Your dinner party.
I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
Really?
I'm resigning.  
After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
Sure...
"C'mon, Harry.  "
We've got a game to win.
What's with the birds?
"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  "
"What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  "
It's chemical.  
Will it last?  
Who knows?  
"Point is, I'm a free agent."
Unbreakable Vow.  
You're sure that's what Snape said.
"It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped.
Look.
You die.
"Lav, c'mon."
Of course I'll wear it.
"It's beautiful, isn't it?  "
The moon.
It was on your bed.  
The box.
Thought I'd try one...
"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
She could never annoy me.  
I think...
I think I love her.
Do you think she knows I exist?
Snogging?  
Who're you talking about?
"Romilda, of course.  "
Romilda Vane.
It's no joke!  
I'm in love with her!
No.  Can you introduce me?
How do I look?
Where's Romilda?
"Hello, darling.  "
Fancy a drink?
What's this?
What happened to me?
I feel really... bad.
"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
Er...
My... Nee...
Er!  
My!  Nee!
Huh?
Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
Don't get me wrong.  
I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  
It's just she seems... a bit put out.
Well... there is... something.
But no.  
It can't be.  
"Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?"
So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
You know.  
Hide the book.
"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
No.
No.  
I got an owl from Dad this morning.  
The one at Borgin & Burke's?  
It's still there.
"Good luck, mate."
What are those?
C'mon.  
Mum's got dinner ready.
"Never done that before, have we?"
I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
Hey ya --
Well... thanks.
Always the tone of surprise.
Going somewhere?
For you?  
You think Madeye died for you?  
You think George took that curse for you?  
"You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
And leave Hermione?  
Are you mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.
Don't tell her I said that.
"Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  "
And there's the wedding...
Bill and Fleur.  
Mum's been planning it for months.  
"Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  "
She'll kill me if I miss it.  
Kill you too.  
Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest.
"Tonight's not the night, mate."
You'd only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
"I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  "
Bits of him.  
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?
"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
Won't he know he's being hunted?
Dunno.  
But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.
Dumbledore?  
And me?  
I dunno.
I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  
He was always polite -- Dumbledore left this?  
For me?
Brilliant.  
Er -- what is it?
Wicked.
Mum used to read me those!  
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
"Oh, c'mon!  "
Beedle's stories are famous!  
Babbity Rabbitty?
No...?
Where are we?
"How the ruddy -- You're amazing, you are."
"They were after you, mate.  "
We'd just put everyone in danger going back.
What she said.
So where do we go from here?  
The Leaky Cauldron?
By the way -- these jeans?  
Not my favorite.  
Bit tight.
This is Dolohov.  
I recognize him from the wanted posters.
"So what do we do with you, huh?"
"Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?
You're the boss.
Hermione?
You're the best with spells.
Can't be.
The Trace breaks at seventeen.
It's Wizarding law.
What?
"We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
What was that about?
Good!  
Tell him from me he's a git!
Hey!  I think you two better come down here.
The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  
Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench.
"Can't see us, of course.  "
But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  
C'mon.  
There's something else you need to see.
R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?
Kreacher...
"You're a thief, Dung.  "
Everyone knows it.
Wicked trainers.
Piece of advice.  
Let's not rehash old times.  
Got it...
mate?
No.  
He's worried he should have got more money for it.
Right.
So let's do it.  
Who gets who?
The world's mental.  
"Come on, drink up.  "
We've got a Horcrux to find.
"In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department."
Oh...
yeah.  
Thanks.
What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?
That's bloody disgusting.
"I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit."
They're not Ministry.  
They're Snatchers.  
They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?
Downstairs...?
Oh my god.  
What am I going to do?
My wife's all alone downstairs?
"No, that's mad.  "
You two find Umbridge.  
I'll be fine.  
But how do I stop it raining?
"Finite Incantatem, okay.  "
And if that doesn't work...?
M-morning.
"Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  "
Where's Hermione?
Bloody cold down here.
What is it? '
"Tis, isn't it?  "
This'll be one to tell the kids.
Mary.  Go home.  
Get the kids.
I'll...
I'll meet you there.  
"We have to get out the country, understand?"
Mary!  Do as I say!
I'm sorry.  
It's just -- Long story.  
Nice meeting you.
Piss off.
"No, don't!  "
Don't say it!
It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name.
That's how they track people now.
It's how they found us in the cafe that night.
I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  
"Blimey, what's that smell?"
Not bloody likely.  
Smells like something Ginny would cook.
Is that it? ...
alive.
It's angry.
"Seems strange, mate.  "
"Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them."
Doesn't that bother you?
I'm hungry.
Leave it.
Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
"Oh, speak English, can't you?"
I said leave it.
Yeah.  
Brilliant.  
"Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  "
And the day before that?  
And the day before that?  
Walk.  
Sleep.  
Walk.
Sleep.
"He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?"
Wizards were here.
The sword was stolen.
"Yeah, I'm still here.  "
But you two carry on.  
Don't let me spoil your fun.
Problem?  
There's no problem.  
"Not according to you, anyway."
"All right, I'll spit it out."
Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find.
"Yeah, I thought I did too."
"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  "
I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  
I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile!
I reckoned you had a plan!
"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"
Don't lie!  
"You said it, too, you said you were disappointed -- Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  "
Do you!  
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or -- And you?
Are you staying?  
Or coming?
Fine.  
I get it.  
I saw you two the other night.  
"Yeah, that's right.  "
"Didn't know I knew, did you?"
Are -- you -- mental?
"Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think."
No.  
I reckoned it was you.
Right.  
Antlers.
"No, I..."
I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there -- Anything?
"And we did, didn't we?"
What?  
No.  Harry.  
That thing's bad for me.  
I can't handle it.
"I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  "
"It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
No.  I can't --
I'm sorry.  
I'm sorry I left.
Saving your life.
And just think of it.  
Only three to go.
Hey.
Wo -- hey -- ouch!
How come he's got your wand?
"No, of course not.  "
I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  
Why would that change anything!  
Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  
"To see you doing those things -- Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  "
I just... didn't know how to find you.
With this.
It doesn't just turn off lights.
"I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I --"
I was sleeping -- in this little pub--
"I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it..."
A voice.
"Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this."
My name.  
Just my name.  
Like a whisper.
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  
And I knew.
Just knew.  
On account of Hermione's voice.  
"And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
I could feel it inside me.  
"It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  "
And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.
So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  
It was dark.  
I didn't have any idea where I was.
I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end.
And you did.
I've always liked it.  
These flames Hermione makes.
How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
It was true.  
Every word.
Bloody hell.  
I just realized.
"You need a wand, right?"
"Well, I've got one.  "
Here.  
"It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  "
I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
"Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  "
This one was definitely part Troll.  
The smell off him...
Wo.
Nothing.
"Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
All right.
But what does it mean?
I think Hermione's right.  
I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.
What say we vote on it?  
Those in favor...
"Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
Luna?
Keep off the dirigible plums.
Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?
He's mental.  
Let's face it.
"Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo."
"Well, yeah, of course.  "
"It's massive, isn't it?"
"Yeah, all right..."
The what?
Yes.
Midnight.  
Mum always said midnight.
But twilight's fine.  
Better actually.
Let's get out of here once he's back.  
"I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold."
The Wand.
"You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  "
Dead boring if you ask me.  
But an unbeatable wand!
"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
Not like Harry's.  
I've seen a fair few.  
Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like.
They always got holes or tears.
Harry's is different.  
It's perfect.
You forgot the water.
For the tea.
Nooooooooo!
That treacherous old bleeder!  
Is there no one we can trust!
I'll do the enchantments.
Don't touch her!
Stan Shunpike.
Weasley...
Barney Weasley.
Piss off!  
Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.
We have to do something.
Let her go.
Works for me.
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
Trust me.
Like hell.
Expellliarmus!
Then you're on our side.
Who put it there?
The fake.
And if we find one?
How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
You're sure it's hers?
You heard Ollivander.
It's Harry's now.
How will we know what it is when we get in there?
"After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
That's a bit scary.
Always good value.
I'll miss her.
What d'you think?
You want to tell me what that is?
You mean he could see you?
Go on.
Bloody hell...
that's a sight.
Hideous.
"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you?"
Dead annoying -- Never mind.
I'm good.  
"That is you in there, isn't it?"
Hey. Easy.
What do you mean?
"Harry, what do we do?"
Harry...?
What's that?
Up ahead.
You don't say.  
Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
Imperio!
No.
It's not possible...
Bloody hell.
That's a Welsh Green.
It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Lumos !
Blimey...
"Is it here, Harry?"
Can you feel anything?
Keep going!
The cup!
Foul little git.
Least we've got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
You're asking us?
You're the brilliant one.
That's your idea?
That was brilliant!
BRILLIANT!
Bloody hell.
I say we jump!
Never mind!
What did you see?
What happens when he finds out four are gone?
What? '
Fraid he's right.
One problem: Snape's Headmaster now.
We can't just walk in the front door.
Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.
What's he mean by that?
Did you get a look at him!
Fora second I thought it was -- Who's that with her?
Bloody hell...
I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
Excuse me.
But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year.
"I mean, I'm only her brother."
"Shut up, Seamus."
"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking."
It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux.
"So we were thinking -- You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right?"
"Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
Harry talks in his sleep.
Haven't you noticed?
I've never got this far before.
Me too.
Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
You do it.
"Yes, you can."
Bloody hell.
We/'ll never find him on this.
Brilliant.
Let's go.
RUN!
Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
Serves him right.
Brilliant.
You're bloody well welcome!
Where will he take her?
"Look inside him, Harry."
Find out where he is.
"If we find him, we find the snake."
Then we're one step closer to ending this.
He's gone.
The snake too.
Never!
Do you hear me!
NEVER!
"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be -- Are you mad!"
No! Rubbish!
"You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him."
Liar!
He saved your life.
"Well done, Malfoy!"
Hermione!
"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
But that means...
What do you reckon we should do with it?
