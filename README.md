# Title: Personality and Language Use in Harry Potter Characters

Team members: Yifei Chen & Chi Kuan Lai (Jessica)

Expected Credits: 6 CPs

## Project Overview
We explored the connection between personality traits and language use by analyzing seven main characters from the Harry Potter films: Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, and Lord Voldemort. Our investigation examined both word-level (lexical categories) and sentence-level (syntactic complexity) linguistic features in relation to the Big Five personality traits.

## Research Question: Do language variables reflect personality factors in Harry Potter characters as in previous LIWC studies?

##  Hypotheses:

Sentence-level: Extroverts use more compound/complex sentences; introverts use simpler ones

Word-level: Specific correlations between personality traits and lexical categories

Dataset: Dialogues from all eight Harry Potter films (originally planned for just the first film, but expanded for sufficient data)

##  Analysis Methods:

Word-level: EMPATH lexicon (free alternative to LIWC) supplemented with SpaCy for missing categories

Sentence-level: SpaCy parsing for sentence structure analysis and complexity metrics
