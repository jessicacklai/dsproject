Title: The Relations Between Personality and Language Use

Keywords LIWC, Personality, Literacy Text Analysis

Research Question
Do language variables of the LIWC refect personality factors as in previous LIWC studies?

Hypotheses
Yes. More specifically (based on findings from previous studies):

Sentence-level:
Extroverted people tend to use more compound sentences (CpdS) and compound complex sentences (CCS) while introverted people use more simple sentence (SS).
Word-level:
Neuroticism is correlated with immediacy.
Extraversion is correlated with distinctions.
Openness is correlated with immediacy and the social past.
Agreeableness is related to immediacy.
conscientiousness is related to distinctions.
Dataset

Corpus: Corpus built on Harry Potter written by J.K. Rowling.
\b With references from literetures on personalities of the characters, we will analyse the features to see if the results align with their personality and if the hypotheses are true.
The number of charcaters will be limited to 5 at most.
Analysis

This mini project is instuitively inspired by the previous work of Pennebaker and King (1999).

We will use LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) as a measure of personality by analysing the lines of selected characters.

For personality, there are many classification methods, we will use the Big Five personality dimensions (Neuroticism/Stability, Extroversion, Openness, Agressableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) as it is widely applied in previous studies.

A factor analysis of the 72 English LIWC variables provided four main factors:

Immediacy: first-persona singular pronouns, articles, long words, present tense, discrepancies.
Distinctions: exclusiceness, tentativeness, negations, inclusive words.
Social past: past tense, positive emotion words, social words.
Rationalisation: insight, negative emotion words, causation words. In sum, we intend to explore the following factors and the according correlation, to see if it aligns with the previous findings.
Immediacy: first-person singular, articles, words of ≥ 6 letters, present tense, discrepencies.
Making distinctions: Exclusive, tentativity, negations, inclusive.
The social past: past tense, social, positive emotion.
Rationalisation: insight, causation, negative emotion.
